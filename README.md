# CS106B
Stanford CS106B and CS106X C++ programs using STL

I learned a ton from CS106B and CS106X! But I couldn't install Stanford C++ libray back then. Can you imagine a
stupid but stubborn guy trying repeatedly to install it over 3 weeks? Finally I gave up. However, I found out I could
use Standard Template Libray (STL) instead. Problem solved!

This repo is for anyone wants to learn data structures and algorithms through CS106B and CS106X using STL.

I always code in a clean and elegent way.
